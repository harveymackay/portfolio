		<h2> What Makes Full Stack Developers Special in 2018 </h2>
		


		<p class="bio">
			If we look through some theoretical aspects, we’ll learn the most widespread meaning of “the full stack developer”. It is a specialist who prefers working equally good in back-end and front-end.

			This term is far from those you may meet in the standard software theory. Such universal specialists appeared thanks to evolution within the technical development. They never stop learning new technologies and employ them in projects.

			And the evolutionary process bears fruit to the labor market. Developer Survey held by Stack Overflow in 2016 shows us that the majority of developers consider themselves as full-stack technicians. 		</p>
